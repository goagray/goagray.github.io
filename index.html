    About Me
  </h2>
  
  <p>
    I am currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science. I have interests in both <strong>Cyber Security</strong> and <strong>Web Development</strong>. When not working on school and leisure projects, I enjoy coaching a club soccer team within the Jackson, MS metro area. <br />
    I always enjoy learning <em>new</em> things, meeting <em>new</em> people, and traveling to <em>new</em> places.
